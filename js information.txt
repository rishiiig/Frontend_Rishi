JavaScript is a singel threaded language.

It is not strictly typed.

type of variables:
    var
    let
    const

==> let and const variables are block scoped i.e.,
        if written like this:
            {
                var a = 5
                let b = 5
                const c = 5
            }
        
        'var' can be accessed here outside of the block
        whereas, 'let' and 'const' are not accessable

but, the concept of local and global variables does apply for the 'var'






In calling functions for 'validating' or 'accessing elements', we use "document."

        The 'document' has the full information of the HTML page.

        'getElementById' is used to get the elemets with their 'ids'
        This get the elements' value
            others are:
                getElementsByClass : Stores in Array
                getElementsByName : Stores in Array
                    etc...
        
    IDs have to be unique for elements
    Many elements can have same CLASS or NAME
